## Topic/Problem

Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, bringing in millions of fans yearly to stadiums, sports bars, and tv screens. Although soccer is seemingly less intricate than other sports, there are countless intricacies within it. With eleven people on a squad, the soccer pitch transforms into a grid with players being the nodes on the coordinate system and completed passes becoming the links. Shots taken become a position-based statistic intertwined with play scenarios and player skill levels. Viewing the beautiful game through an analytic lens leads us to a pivotal question. In the game of soccer, can we find patterns in soccer match data? 

Narrowing down the scope of finding patterns, we want to focus on analyzing shots. We will attempt to answer questions like: “where have players been most likely to score from?” or “under what situation have players scored more?” (direct free kick, corner kick, set piece, open play, penalty) or “does time during the game play a role in the success rate?” The goal of our visualization is for users to explore different shot scenarios and discover emerging patterns. Overall, we want to address where and when the best soccer shots are created.
